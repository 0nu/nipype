This is the initial release of nipype, version 0.1.  Nipype is still
in early stages of development, but we will be continuing to improve
the software and will release versions regularly.

The goals of this release were the following:

* Basic repository structure
* Basic development infrastructure (bug tracking, version numbers,
  release process, etc.)
* Minimal dependencies
* Basic documentation of working features.
* A working pipeline using SPM
* Interfaces to a basic set of functionality for each of the main
  packages: SPM, FSL, AFNI
