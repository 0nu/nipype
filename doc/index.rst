   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome
=======

This is the documentation for NIPY's interfaces and pipeline project,
nipype.  Nipype intends to create python interfaces to other
neuroimaging packages and create an API for specifying a full analysis
pipeline in python.  Currently, we have interfaces for SPM and FSL in
some stage of development.

Nipype is part of the NIPY_ project, but exists independently to allow
for a different release cycle.
