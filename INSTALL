 Development quickstart
========================

Source Code
===========

NIPYPE uses sourceforge_ for our code hosting.  For immediate access to
the source code, see the `nipy sourceforge`_ site.

Guidelines
==========

We have adopted many developer guidelines in an effort to make
development easy, and the source code readable, consistent and robust.
Many of our guidelines are adopted from the scipy_ / numpy_ community.
We welcome new developers to the effort, if you're interested in
developing code or documentation please join the `nipy mailing list`_
and introduce yourself.  If you plan to do any code development, we
ask that you take a look at the following guidelines.  We do our best
to follow these guidelines ourselves:

* `How to document <http://neuroimaging.scipy.org/site/doc/manual/html/devel/guidelines/howto_document.html#howto-document>`_   
   Documentation is critical.  This document describes the documentation 
   style, syntax, and tools we use.

* `Numpy/Scipy Coding Style Guidelines:
  <http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines>`_
  This is the coding style we strive to maintain.

* `Testing <http://neuroimaging.scipy.org/site/doc/manual/html/devel/guidelines/testing.html#testing>`_ 
  We've adopted a rigorous testing framework.

* `Optimization <http://neuroimaging.scipy.org/site/doc/manual/html/devel/guidelines/optimization.html#optimization>`_ "premature optimization is the root of all
  evil."
